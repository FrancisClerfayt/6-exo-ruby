# Instead of entering grade by grade, we enter all the grades on a single entry separated by spaces, 
# the validation would send the grades.

# We ask for the grades

# We get th grades

# We separate the grades

# we print the number of grades
puts "il y a eu #{grades.length} notes saisies"
# we print the result
